In my [previous]({{page.assets}}/secret-colors.html) post, I introduced readers to my new `python` library called [SecretColors](https://pypi.org/project/SecretColors/) to get excellent colors to your python workflow. Essentially this library has collections of various different color palettes and very easy API to access them without searching for hex codes or RGB values.
