I am a computational biologist by training. I like building mathematical models and playing around with them. I also spend significant amount of time learning new technique of data analysis and visualization. In this ‘data heavy’ world, with continuous bombarding of data, finding patterns has becoming hobby of mine. I used to perform basic data analysis on variety of datasets and used to visualize them. Sometimes I got some new correlations or patterns while sometimes I used some fancy visualization. It was just pure fun. I used to code a little, run some scripts and generate plots. Now I have decided to document these small visualization, analysis and patterns.
