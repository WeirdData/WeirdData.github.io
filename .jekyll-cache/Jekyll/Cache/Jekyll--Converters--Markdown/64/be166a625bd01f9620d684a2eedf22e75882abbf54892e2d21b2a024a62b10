I"à<p>I was developing one android app for storing bank account details securely. One of the fuction I was thinking of adding was to search bank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Financial_System_Code">IFSC</a> code. For this purpose I needed database of all Indian banks who have valid IFSC code. This code is imporant for performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electronic_Funds_Transfer">NEFT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_gross_settlement">RTGS</a> transactions. In search of such database I scaned Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs (RBI) website. I did find that <a href="https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=2009">database</a> however total size of that database was more than 10 MB. Hence it was not a good idea to embbed this data into app itself. On top of that, I need to update this database in future as RBI approves new bank branches. Finally I found good <a href="https://github.com/razorpay/ifsc-api">API</a> for achieving this. After that when I was about to delete all the files related to downloaded data, my inner data scientist woke up and I decided to analyze this data further.</p>

<h3 id="the-database">The Database</h3>

<p>Developers at <a href="https://ifsc.razorpay.com/">RazorPay</a> have compiled all of the RBI data into properly <a href="https://github.com/razorpay/ifsc/releases">labeled dataset</a>. This made my job even easier. I wrote simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code> <a href="https://gist.github.com/rohitsuratekar/15b3ea7a97e0f6a86aa91bb54dc9fed4">script</a> to analyze this dataset. This dataset had <strong>141996</strong> entries <sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup> on 7 July 2018 (Note: all further analysis is done on data available on 7 July 2018.).</p>

<p>This itself is very big number. This suggest there are on average <strong>3944</strong> bank branches per state (29 states + 7 union territories). There is 1 bank branch per <strong>9325</strong> citizens. This is significantly higher number compare to United States. It had 80,227 FDIC-insured commercial bank in 2016 <sup><a href="#myfootnote2">2</a></sup>. That comes down to only 1 bank per 4682  citizens. Although this statistics is 2 year old, going by average growth in US banks in past 10 years <sup><a href="#myfootnote2">2</a></sup>, we can assume this number won‚Äôt change drastically for 2018. Now we can analyze this data in little bit more details.</p>

<h3 id="distribution-by-banks">Distribution by Banks</h3>
<p>First, I checked which bank has most number of branches in India.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/article_images/2018-07-07-bank-analysis/bank_wise.png" alt="Fig 1: Bank Wise Distribution of Indian Banks" title="Bank Wise" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Fig 1: Bank Wise Distribution of Indian Banks</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br />
As expected, with 26222 branches all over the India, <strong>State Bank of India</strong> (SBI) has most number of branches (Fig 1). It is 18.46 % of all bank branches. These top 10 banks accounts for <strong>53.10%</strong> of total Indian bank branches.</p>

<h3 id="disribution-by-geography">Disribution by geography</h3>

<p>Next I checked how bank branches are distributed geographically.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/article_images/2018-07-07-bank-analysis/state_wise.png" alt="Fig 2: State Wise Distribution of Indian Banks" title="State Wise" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Fig 2: State Wise Distribution of Indian Banks</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br />
Fig 2 shows top 10 states (or union territories) who has most number of bank branches. With 18220 branches <strong>Maharashtra</strong> tops this list. This is 12.83% of total bank branches in India. This is <strong>88.25%</strong> of total branches in India.</p>

<p>However this can be misleading as population of these states are very different. To understand which state has more number of bank branches per person, I used population database <sup><a href="#myfootnote3">3</a></sup>. I just normalized number of bank branches with its population (Fig 3).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/article_images/2018-07-07-bank-analysis/pop_to_branch.png" alt="Fig 3: Top 10 state who has highest number of bank branches per person." title="Branch to Population Ratio" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Fig 3: Top 10 state who has highest number of bank branches per person.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br />
Fig 4 suggest that Chandigarh has highest number of bank branches per person (Branches: 1990, Population: 1110820 <sup><a href="#myfootnote3">3</a></sup>).</p>

<h3 id="more-details">More details</h3>

<p>Generally we presume bank branches will be concentrated in metro cities. To test this hypothesis I checked how is the city wise distribution.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/article_images/2018-07-07-bank-analysis/city_wise.png" alt="Fig 4: City wise distribution of bank branches." title="City Wise" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Fig 4: City wise distribution of bank branches.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Indeed they are concentrated in metro cities. Fig 4 shows exactly same trend. As I was expecting most number of banks are present in Indias financial capital, <strong>Mumbai</strong> <sup><a href="#myfootnote4">4</a></sup>, with 3132 bank branches which is 17.18% of all bank branches in Maharashtra. National capital <strong>Delhi</strong> <sup><a href="#myfootnote5">5</a></sup> was on second place with 3047 bank branches. These top 10 cities have <strong>16.18%</strong> of India‚Äôs total bank branches. Finally I checked how different banks are distributed within these top 10 cities.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/article_images/2018-07-07-bank-analysis/complex.png" alt="Fig 5: City wise distribution of branches of top banks." title="Complex Wise" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Fig 5: City wise distribution of branches of top banks.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br /></p>
