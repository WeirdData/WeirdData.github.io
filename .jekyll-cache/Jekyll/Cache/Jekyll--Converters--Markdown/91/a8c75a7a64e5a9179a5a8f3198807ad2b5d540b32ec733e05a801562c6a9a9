I"<<p>I am a computational biologist by training. I spend a significant amount of time learning a new technique of data analysis and visualization. In this ‘data heavy’ world, with continuous bombarding of data, finding patterns has become a hobby of mine. I used to perform basic data analysis on a variety of datasets and used to visualize them. Sometimes I got some new correlations or patterns while sometimes I used some fancy visualization. It was just pure fun. I used to code a little, run some scripts and generate plots. Now I have decided to document these small visualizations, analysis, and patterns.

If you have any new idea/data for such analysis or visualization, get in touch with <a href="mailto:rohitsuratekar@gmail.com" target="_blank">me</a>. I am up for any productive collaborations :D</p>
