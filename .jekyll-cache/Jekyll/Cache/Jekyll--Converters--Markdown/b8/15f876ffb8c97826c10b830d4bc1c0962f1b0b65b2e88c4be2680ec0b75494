I"~=<p>Indian Railways is the largest railway network by passenger transport <sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup> while 4th largest by total track route <sup><a href="#myfootnote2">2</a></sup>. This system is a backbone of long-distance Indian transport providing affordable commute to a commoner. Fig 1 shows an overview of the complicated network of railway tracks spanning all over India. To get a clear idea and appreciate this tremendous structure I decided to dig deeper. In addition, this makes it a very interesting data-set for applying some of the data-science and visualization techniques.</p>

<h3 id="collection-of-data">Collection of data</h3>

<p>As expected there were plenty of data-sets in a context of Indian Railways. However, most of them required me to use some web scrapping or their own API with some restrictions. Also, I wanted to get some credible source. Most of the data sets were outdated, I was not able to get any data set for the current year. Finally, I found official source <sup><a href="#myfootnote3">3</a></sup> in Open Government Data (<a href="https://data.gov.in">OGD</a>) Platform of  India. This has information about Indian Railways Time Table for trains available for reservation as on 1 Nov 2017. This was good enough start and I was happy about it. This data was lacking geographical information regarding railway stations. For visualization, information regarding the geography of railway stations was crucial. To obtain this information, I had to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">selenium</code> along with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">geckodriver</code>. You can get all the code used in this analysis from <a href="https://github.com/WeirdData/RailwayVisualization">RailwayVisualization</a> repository. Please check respective code blocks for details about how this information was extracted. The code is heavily commented for readability.</p>

<h3 id="general-statistics">General Statistics</h3>

<p>To understand spread of our data, I checked some general statistics. Please note, all the analysis presented below is done on  the data obtained from official website <sup><a href="#myfootnote3">3</a></sup> while geographical information is scrapped from thrid party <sup><a href="#myfootnote4">4</a></sup> website <a href="https://indiarailinfo.com/atlas">Indiarailinfo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Here, origin station represents a total number of railway stations which are source station for one or more trains. The total number of trains also include local trains. Total distance covered is the summation of all the distances covered by each train from its source to destination. Every train is counted as only once.</p>

<p>Total distance covered is <strong>3878092 Km</strong>. This is a huge number. This is <strong>9.5 times</strong> larger than distance between the Earth and the Moon <sup><a href="#myfootnote5">5</a></sup> and <strong>96.8 times</strong> larger than the Earth’s circumference <sup><a href="#myfootnote6">6</a></sup>. Even if we assume every train runs only once in a week (<em>which is obviously not true</em>), Indian railways will cover on the average total distance of <strong>554013.14 Km/day</strong> (still greater than the distance between the Earth and the Moon <sup><a href="#myfootnote5">5</a></sup>)</p>

<h3 id="geographical-distribution">Geographical Distribution</h3>

<p>Above statistic was amusing but did not give any idea about how this network is distributed across India. As India is very geographically diverse, I was expecting to see this diversity reflected in the railway network. To access this, the only information I had in the current database was station names. I decided to check how the Indian railway looks from every station’s perspective.</p>

<h4 id="station-with-most-number-of-trains">Station with most number of trains</h4>

<p>I checked which railway station<sup><a href="#myfootnote9">9</a></sup> is visited by a maximum number of unique trains (distinct train numbers). In this analysis, each train and its stops are counted.</p>

      <td style="text-align: center">Fig 2: The top 10 railway stations which are visited by most number of unique trains.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Fig 2 shows the top 10 stations which are visited by the most number of unique trains. I think this plot is a little bit biased because of local and suburban train stations. Stations represented in this figure hosts local trains along with another kind. Nonetheless, these stations are visited by the most number of unique trains. I was not able to get hold of all local, suburban and metro train data. To remove this bias I decided to remove all short distance train from this list.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This was a little tricky and crude analysis. As you can see in Fig 3, there was no clear division between short distance versus long-distance trains. Hence I decided to use Mumbai <sup><a href="#myfootnote7">7</a></sup> to calculate the diameter of the city which I can use as a cut off to remove short distance trains. I used <strong>27.71 Km</strong> as a distance cut off to remove short distance trains.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Fig 4 shows the new top 10 list after removing short distance trains. There is very little change in top stations. I am a little bit confident about this result because you can see ‘Dum Dum Jn.’ (which is the suburban railway junction ), ‘Dadar’ (on western line), ‘Kurla’ (on central line) was removed from the top list while ‘Panvel’ (connects local to Indian Rail on Harbour line), ‘New Delhi’ (Indian capital) and ‘Moor Market’ (Chennai Central) was added to the list. However, we need actual local/suburban train data for the precise list.</p>

<p>Just for the sake of curiosity I also checked top stations by putting cut off of 500 km which will tell you regional or zonal hubs for such long-distance trains.</p>

<p>I think Fig 6 also has a similar bias to what we discussed in the previous section. However, we can see these are almost the same stations which we examined previously. I also checked same statistics for destination and it gave me the same plot. Suggesting there are generally opposite direction trains between stations. To test this hypothesis I checked top station pairs which act as origin and destinations.</p>

      <td style="text-align: center">Fig 7: Top railway origin-destination pairs which has most number of trains in between them.</td>

</table>

<p>My theory was correct! There was indeed a pair of stations where an equal number of trains runs from both sides. However, this is just top 10 station pairs. This pattern might change as we look at more station pairs.</p>
